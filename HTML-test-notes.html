<h1>This is the most important heading</h1> 
<hr/>
<!-- This comment is to let you know there is a horizontal line above it -->
<p>This is a paragraph. </p>
<h2>This heading is also important but not quite as much</h2>
<p>This is another paragraph but there is a line break in it
here <br/> that puts this line under it. </p>
<h3>This is a semi-important heading</h3>
<hr/>
<p>The following is a test of different text types:<br/>
<b>This is bold.</b><br/>
<big>This should be big.</big><br/>
<i>This is italic text.</i><br/>
<small>This should be small.</small><br/>
<strong>This is apparently very strong text.</strong><br/>
<sub>This is a subscript, </sub>
<sup>and this is a superscript.</sup><br/>
<ins>This text is inserted, </ins>
<del>and this text is deleted.</del>

<h4>These are the lower ranking headings</h4>
<h5>These headings shouldn't be used just to make your text big and bold</h5>
<h6>This is because headings are used to index by search engines</h6>
